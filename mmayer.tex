\cvsection{Carrer summary}
\begin{quote}
Currently in second year at Epitech Cotonou in order to increase my level in programming, I'm an IT developer with skills in Linux System Administrator. With Epitech's Pedagogy, I learnt how to work with a team and how to be autonomous. I love to be constantly in challenge, in order to apply my skills and also to improve them. For now, I'm learning C++ language, web development using multiple tools, frameworks and libraries both in frontend and backend.  I'm also learning cloud computing.
